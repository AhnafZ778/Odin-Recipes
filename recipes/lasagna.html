    <h3>A Delicious and Cheesy Lasagna Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../Images/lasagna.jpg" height="500" width="800">
    <p>Very simple and easy to make lasagna recipe of our intern Maldini's Nonna</p>
    <p>If you're too lazy to make this recipe then you should honestly not call yourself a foodie</p>
    <p>It's an extremely hearty and warm food which surprisingly in contrast to all the other lasagna recipes out there isn't filled to the brim with unhealthy ingredients.</p>
    <p>These contain only fresh ingredients which you will be easily able to source from your local super market or wholesale market</p>
    <p>It only takes 20-30 minutes max to finish prepping this delicious lasagna and an additional hour to bake in the over and voila you have an incredibly</p>
    <p>delicious and salivating Lasagna made at home which will easily beat any restaurant lasagna out there. However, I do have to warn you this dish does come with a caution</p>
    <p>"If eaten alone and not shared you might wake up the next morning as an Italian Rat going around making Ratatouille " just a rumour I heard but better safe than sorry amirite</p>
    <ins><h3>Ingredients</h5></ins>
    <ul>
        <li>Lasagna: Look for the freshest one you can find, I will be using a homemade one my Nonna made</li>
        <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor, or make my homemade Italian sausage.</li>
        <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the cheese filling has ricotta and parmesan with seasonings. You can make homemade ricotta cheese or replace it with cottage cheese.</li>
        <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer). If using store-bought sauce, I love Rao’s for flavor.</li>
        <li>Spinach (variation): Spinach is optional but delicious in lasagna. For spinach lasagna, thaw 10oz of frozen spinach, squeeze out the moisture, and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
        <li>Egg: The yolks specifically will be needed to brush the top of the lasagna layer for some crust</li>
        <li>Parsley: Mostly gonna be used as garnish when plating</li>
        <li>Garlic: The absolute essential for making the dish more flavourful</li>
        <li>Spices: Must needs for any Italian dish</li>
        <li>Onions: To balance the entire dish out</li>
    </ul>
    <ins><h3>Steps of Making the Lasagna</h4></ins>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil pasta: In a large pot of salted water boil lasagna noodles per the recipe below.</li>
        <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce (I love this brand) & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until the top of the lasagna is golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
    <ins><h3>Instructions</h3></ins>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>the oven to 350°F. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and cook until al dente (firm) according to package directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
        <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian seasoning, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5 minutes or until slightly thickened. Taste and season with additional salt if desired.</li>
        <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 ½ cups mozzarella cheese, ¼ cup parmesan cheese, ricotta, parsley, egg, and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9X13 pan or casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer with ⅓ of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup of meat sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped with remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove the foil and sprinkle the top of the lasagna with the remaining 2 ½ cups mozzarella cheese and ¼ cup parmesan cheese. Bake uncovered for an additional 15 minutes or until browned and bubbly. Broil for 2-3 minutes if desired.</li>
        <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting.</li>

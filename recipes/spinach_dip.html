    <p>This is the perfect no-cook, one-bowl summer dip to bring to a picnic or barbecue. Simply mix together sour cream, mayo, spinach, chopped water chestnuts, and soup mix, allow the flavors to meld in the fridge, then serve with bread, chips, or veggies. It's as easy as that and completely delicious—over 1,100 five-star reviews agree. My dad's spinach dip recipe. The entire family loves this flavorful spinach mixture served in a tasty bread bowl. Your family will love it, too.</p>
